# Explorer

## Deployment

TODO...

## Setup

### Install packages

```
yarn install
cd client && yarn install && cd -
```

### Database Configuration

##### Creation

[TypeORM](https://typeorm.io/#/) requires you to create the db manually,
and in our case that will involve leverage postgresql's `createdb`:

```
createdb explorer_dev
yarn migration:run
```

##### Deletion

```
dropdb explorer_dev
```

##### Connection

[TypeORM](https://typeorm.io/#/migrations) has been configured to load
`ormconfig.<env>.json`. Therefore, if in development, it loads `ormconfig.development.json`,
if production, `ormconfig.production.json`.

##### Running alongside Chainlink Node (dev)

```
$ EXPLORER_URL=ws://localhost:8080 cldev node
$ yarn run dev # in another terminal
```

##### Migrations

Please see [TypeORM's migration guide](https://typeorm.io/#/migrations).

## Typescript

If you would like to add an npm package that doesn't have Typescript support you will need
to add the type definition yourself and make the Typescript transpiler aware of it. Custom
types are stored in the `types` directory.

```
echo "declare module 'my-package'" > types/my-package.d.ts
```

To make the the transpiler aware of the new type definition you will also need to add it to
the `"files": ...` section of `tsconfig.json`.

```
{
  // ...

  "files": [
    // ...
    "types/my-package.d.ts"
  ]
}
```
